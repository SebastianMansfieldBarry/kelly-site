                              into a single transaction or to establish a business relationship, the institution
                              must, in the course of concluding that single transaction or establishing that
                              business relationship and in accordance with its Risk Management and

                          <p> (i) the identity of that other person; and </p>
                          <p> (ii) the client’s authority to establish the business relationship or to conclude
                            the single transaction on behalf of that other person; and </p>
                          <p> (c) if another person is acting on behalf of the client, establish and verify—
                          </p>
                          <p> (i) the identity of that other person; and </p>
                          <p> (ii) that other person’s authority to act on behalf of the client. </p>
                          <p> (2) If an accountable institution had established a business relationship with a
                              client before this Act took effect, the accountable institution may not conclude
                              a transaction in the course of that business relationship, unless the
                              accountable institution has taken the prescribed steps—</p>
                          <p> (a) to establish and verify the identity of the client; </p>
                          <p> (b) if another person acted on behalf of the client in establishing the business
                              relationship, to establish and verify— (i) the identity of that other person; and
                              (ii) that other person’s authority to act on behalf of the client; </p>
                          <p> (c) if the client acted on behalf of another person in establishing the business
                              relationship, to establish and verify— (i) the identity of that other person; and
                              (ii) the client’s authority to act on behalf of that other person; and </p>
                          <p> (d) to trace all accounts at that accountable institution that are involved in
                              transactions concluded in the course of that business relationship. </p>
