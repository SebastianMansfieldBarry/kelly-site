                    <p>An affidavit is a written statement made under oath. If the affidavit contains anything
                      untruthful that person who deposed (made an oath to its authenticity) can be prosecuted for
                      perjury.</p>

                      issued, if asked for, and that the delay caused by requesting the warrant would defeat the point

                    <p>An uncontested divorce is the term used when
                      both parties agree to the terms of the divorce, it is possible to dissolve the marriage within 4
                      weeks. A contested divorce is when either or both parties don’t agree to the terms of divorce this
                      can take anything up to 3 years and are usually settled before a trail is arranged. The process
                      starts with a summons being served on the other party.</p>
